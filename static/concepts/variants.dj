Given the vast [complexity](/concepts/complexity) of competitive Pokémon, there exist numerous
possibilities for [abstractions](/glossary#abstraction) which can simplify the problem space.
Outside of more general modifications that can be made to almost any game to decrease the difficulty
(_e.g._, increasing the amount of time available per decision), these relaxations can be grouped
into three broad categories --- those which reduce the [scope of the game](#Game) as a whole, those
which [increase the amount of information](#Information) revealed, and those which pare down the
state space through arbitrary [restrictions](#Restrictions).

### Game

As [detailed in the glossary](/glossary#game), the _game_ of competitive Pokémon is made up of a
couple mostly orthogonal components --- _i.e._, [team-building](/glossary#team-building) and
[piloting](/glossary#piloting) (and optionally [drafting](/glossary/#drafting)). Most often these
components are treated separately, as attempting to solve competitive Pokémon as a whole approaches
[general-game playing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing) in terms of difficulty.

### Information

Revealing information which is usually hidden or unknown can prove quite effective at making solving
competitive Pokémon tractable, though care must be taken as doing so can dramatically impact the
nature of the game:

- knowledge of **available choices** (_e.g._, whether the player's active Pokémon is trapped or
  disabled) is one of the most minimal modifications that can be made to the game, and mostly exists
  as a development convenience (allows you to be fully aware of the available choices without having
  to deal with uncertainty) and has relatively minor implications to actual playing strength or
  realism
- knowledge of an **opponent's HP** (either exact HP or increased accuracy via the `HP Percentage
  Clause Mod`) is helpful for being able to perform [reverse damage
  calculation](/glossary/#reverse-damage-calculator) and more quickly [infer](/glossary/#inference)
  the opponent's sets, but is still minor enough to not have dramatic gameplay implication (most
  standard play in Smogon University's metagames between human players already leverages this)
- knowledge of an **opponent's team** makeup and configuration is significantly more artificial as
  it removes the aspect of information gathering/hiding and provides a significant advantage to the
  player, but as the battle progresses team prediction eventually determines this information
  anyway. This is the most common simplication and [many different options exist](#Restrictions) in
  this area
- knowledge of further **hidden information** known only to the engine (_e.g._, remaining sleep
  turns) beyond what's covered above but while still retaining some stochastic aspects without
  revealing the [RNG](/glossary#RNG) seed is difficult to pin down, as exactly what information
  should be revealed is rather arbitrary
- knowledge of the  **RNG seed** (which both provides full information on existing unknown
  information such as duration of various statuses and limited knowledge of immediate future
  outcomes) helps [**determinize**](/glossary#determinization) the game tree by effectively removing
  [stochasticity](/glossary#stochastic), though the amount of unknowns revealed means that game play
  starts to get too artificial
- knowledge of the **opponent's upcoming move** during the current turn is interesting in that it
  [**sequentializes**](/glossary#sequentialization) the game (thus removing the complications of
  dealing with [simultaneity](/glossary/#SM)), but obviously dramatically changes how the game is
  played

Note that the preceding options aren't necessarily always mutually exclusive --- modifications can
be combined to produce different potentially interesting gameplay variants.

### Restrictions

Some of the biggest reductions in [information set](/glossary#information-set) size can be obtained
through restrictions on the rules involved with team-building:

- game options can be restricted to a **predefined subset** of Pokémon
  Species/Moves/Abilities/Items. Almost all competitive Pokémon formats restrict options to some
  extent (_e.g._, from banning "mythical" Pokémon in Nintendo formats or Pokémon which are highly
  used in Smogon University's to a combination of limitations such as those found in [Little
  Cup](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/lc/)), though this can be taken to extremes (_e.g._, a
  [*conmeta*](/glossary#conmeta) like the ["Shanai
  Cup"](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706011535/http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?6273))
- players can be forced build teams only from a pool of specific Pokémon species that were
  previously selected in a **draft** phase by the player with knowledge of their opponent's pool of
  allowed Pokémon species (_e.g._, Smogon University's [Draft
  Leagues](https://www.smogon.com/articles/beginners-guide-draft)). This change reduces the number
  of possible movesets for both players, but also changes team-building due to being able to cater
  one's team through exploiting knowledge of an opponent's options (it also introduces a "drafting"
  component to "team-building" and "piloting")
- allowing players to only choose teams from a fixed pool of **sample teams** as opposed to building
  ones from scratch. This simplifies the team-building component (rendering it a "team-selection"
  component) and also greatly reduces information set size during play provided the pool only
  consists of a limited number of teams
- requiring Pokémon on teams be drawn from a specific pool of possible sets, similar to how
  [**Battle Factory**](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Factory_(Generation_IV))
  rental Pokémon work on the [cartridge](/glossary#cartridge) games
- allowing for Pokémon sets to vary, but **restricting set variation** by limiting the pool of
  possible choices for each field. _e.g._, [Pokémon Showdown's Random
  Battle](https://www.smogon.com/articles/random-formats-overview) formats
- providing a [**preview**](/glossary#Team-Preview) of the opponent's team before the battle and
  introducing a phase before the battle takes place where players can select their team order
  (_e.g._, most formats post Generation V).
- reducing a team's maximum size from the standard default of 6 vs.6 to either a strict **$`N` _vs._
  $`N`** before the battle, or through a **bring $`M` choose $`N`** mechanic where players must
  select a subset of their original team to actually battle with (_e.g._, [Battle Stadium
  Singles](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/battle-stadium-singles/) or Smogon University's
  [1v1](https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/1v1/) format)
- requiring players to share information about their team with their opponent before the match via
  **open team sheets** (_e.g._, [Nintendo's Pokémon Video Game Championship ruleset in
  2023](https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/pdf/play-pokemon/rules/play-pokemon-vg-team-list-2023.pdf))

As with [information](#Information), some of these restrictions can be combined to arbitrarily bound
the size of the information set (_e.g._, [obi's 1v1 thought
experiment](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/61246/) which combines maximum team size
restrictions and aspects of drafting).
