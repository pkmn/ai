abstraction: |
  A method for solving incomplete information games that are too large to be solved in their
  original form. The original game is abstracted to create a smaller game that's strategically
  similar, such that the new abstract game can be solved and the solution can be mapped back to the
  original to serve as an approximation to the true solution to the original game. In Pokémon,
  techniques such as [bucketing](#bucketing) can be used to reduce the state space or the original
  game may be mapped to a [variant](#variant) which is more tractable.
action: |
  A feasible operation on the [state](#state) --- _i.e._, a move a [player](#player) can make at a
  stage in the [game](#game). [move]{.dfn} is ambiguous in Pokémon, as Pokémon have
  [moves](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Move) and thus some of the game theoretical moves
  of a player in a Pokémon battle include the action of literally using one of their Pokémon's
  moves. [Pokémon Showdown](#PS) and [pkmn](#pkmn) instead use the terms _choice_ and _choices_
  instead of _action_ and _actions_, and [PokeSim](https://github.com/aed3/poke-sim/) refers to this
  as a [_decision_](https://github.com/aed3/poke-sim/blob/main/DESIGN_SPEC.md#decision) - all of
  these should be interchangeable, though using move to refer to an action / choice / decision
  should be avoided. Both player's choices considered together are called the [joint
  action](#joint-action), and applying the joint action to the battle state causes a
  [transition](#transition).
activation function: |
  A mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron within a [neural network](#NN),
  introducing the non-linearity crucial for enabling the network to learn complex patterns. Various
  activation functions are commonly used:

    - _sigmoid_, also know as the _logistic_ function, an introductory activation unit commonly used
    in logistic regression that maps values between 0 and 1 though suffers from vanishing gradient
    issues.
    - _$`tanh`_ maps values between -1 and 1 and is similar to the sigmoid but with better gradient
    behavior.
    - _ReLU_, or Rectified Linear Units, outputs 0 for negative inputs and the input itself for
    positive values are popular for resistances of the vanishing gradient problem and fast
    computation. Many variants exist, such as the _Leaky ReLU_ that avoids the "dying ReLU" problem
    by having a small non-zero slope for negative inputs
    - _Softmax_ maps its output to values between 0 and 1 but in such a way that the total sum is 1,
    making it a probability distribution
agent: |
  An intelligent agent ([IA]{.dfn}) is an entity that autonomously acts upon an environment to
  achieve its goals. In computer chess, the individual agents are usually referred to as _engines_,
  but in competitive Pokémon artificial intelligence circles agent or [bot](#bot) is preferred as
  [engine](#engine) is used to refer to the code responsible for the simulation of core Pokémon
  battle mechanics.
alpha-beta: |
  Alpha-beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are
  evaluated by the [minimax](#minimax) algorithm in its search tree. When applied to a standard
  minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but [prunes](#pruning) away branches that
  can't possibly influence the final decision. Alpha-beta has been shown to also work in
  [simultaneous move](#SM) games in [(Bošanský 2013)](/research#Bošanský:2013){.subtle} and
  [(Saffidine 2021)](/research#Saffidine:2021){.subtle}, where it typically gets abbreviated as
  [SMAB]{.dfn}. [Failure types](#failure-type) are an important concept in alpha-beta search.
AlphaGo: |
  An influential artificial intelligence agent that achieved superhuman
  [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) performance using a combination of [Monte Carlo tree
  search](#MCTS) and [neural networks](#NN) [(Silver 2016)](/research#Silver:2016){.subtle}. Along
  with AlphaZero [(Silver 2017)](/research#Silver:2017){.subtle} and MuZero [(Silver
  2018)](/research#Silver:2018){.subtle}, the AlphaGo architecture serves as the modern foundation
  for many perfect information game-playing agents (_e.g._, [Lc0](#Lc0)).
anytime: |
  An algorithm that can return a valid solution to a problem even if it's interrupted before it
  ends.
aspiration windows: |
  A technique for reducing the search space in [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) search by using a window
  around a guess of the expected [value](#value) as the alpha-beta bounds. The guess is usually
  derived from the last iteration in [iterative deepening](#iterative-deepening) and [gradual
  widening]{.dfn} of the window may be used during re-searches in the event of failure.
backward induction: |
  Backward induction is a decision-making process that involves starting at the end of the game and
  working backward to determine the best course of action. It works by identifying the optimal
  choice at the final decision point (assuming rational actors), and then using that knowledge to
  determine the optimal choice at the second-to-last decision point, and so on until the beginning
  is reached.
bandit: |
  The [multi-armed bandit problem]{.dfn} is a classic [reinforcement learning](#RL) problem that
  codifies the exploration--exploitation tradeoff dilemma. In the problem, a fixed limited set of
  resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their
  expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation,
  and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. In terms
  of competitive Pokémon AIs, bandit problems arise when determining which parts of the [search tree
  to explore](#TBS), and _bandit_ usually refers to the particular type of algorithm being used to
  solve the bandit problem (_e.g._, [UCB](#UCB) or [Exp3](#Exp3)).
Bayes' rule: |
  The mathematical rule that describes how to update a [belief](#belief), given some evidence.
  Fundamental to Bayesian [inference](#inference) used by Pokémon AI in combination with [usage
  statistics](#usage-stats) to reason about what [state](#state) they may be in.
Bayeselo: |
  [Bayesian Elo Rating](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/), a commonly used tool for
  estimating the [Elo](#Elo) rating based on matches between computerized agents.
belief: |
  A player's probabilistic assessment of the current state of the game, particularly when they have
  imperfect [information](#information), often represented as probability distributions over possible
  hidden [states](#state). Players update their beliefs based on available observations and the
  [actions](#action) of others, and these beliefs crucially influence their decision-making process,
  as they attempt to choose actions that maximize their expected [payoff](#payoff) given their
  understanding of the game's true state.
bigram: |
  A sequence of two adjacent symbols in particular order. The concept can be generalized to an
  arbitrary number of symbols ([n-gram]{.dfn}), though sometimes the term bigram is (incorrectly)
  used for the general case as well. While bigrams can crop up in many different places within
  competitive Pokémon artificial intelligence, when referenced in an unqualified manner they usually
  refer to joint probabilities processed from [usage statistics](#usage-stats) such as $`P(Move \mid
  Species \land Move)`. These can also sometimes be called [correlations]{.dfn}.
bimatrix game: |
  A [simultaneous game](#SM) for two players in which each player has a finite set of actions. Such
  a game can be fully described by two matrices, each describing the payoffs of one of the players.
  In an adversarial game, the two matrices will sum to a constant matrix.
binding: |
  Either refers to a [language binding]{.dfn}, the application programming interface that provides
  glue code specifically made to allow a programming language to use a foreign library or operating
  system service, or a specific class of moves in Pokémon known as [[binding
  moves]{.dfn}](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bound) which prevent their target from
  switching and causes damage for multiple turns (also known as _wrapping_ or _partial-trapping_
  moves).
BoN: |
  Abbreviation for Best-of-$`N`, where $`N` refers to the number of games used to decide the winner
  of a set of battles between two players (usually 1 or 3, _e.g._, _BO3_).
bot: |
  Slang term for [agent](#agent) derived from the word _robot_. Alternatively, the term may be used
  to characterize the parts of the [client](#client) code responsible for connecting and
  communicating with the [server](#server) and distinguishing it from the core [search](#search) /
  [knowledge](#knowledge) components of the agent.
branching factor: |
  The number of children at each node in a [game tree](#game-tree); the outdegree.
bucketing: |
  Also known as [data binning]{.dfn}, a generalization of rounding data where the original data that
  falls within a small interval (known as a _bin_ or _bucket_) gets replaced by a value
  representative of that interval. This is a form of [abstraction](#abstraction), the canonical
  examples of bucketing in competitive Pokémon AI research are reducing the range of possible HP
  values or shrinking the number of damage [rolls](#roll).
cartridge: |
  The game of Pokémon as it exists on the original Nintendo console hardware (due to the earliest
  [generations](#generation) of Pokémon being played on Game Boy ROM cartridges).
CFR: |
  [Counterfactual Regret Minimization]{.dfn} is an iterative algorithm designed to find approximate
  [Nash equilibria](#NE) in [extensive-form games](#EFG) with [imperfect information](#information).
  It works by calculating the [counterfactual regret](#regret) at each decision point, which
  measures how much a player would regret not having taken a different action, given the information
  available at that point. CFR then updates its strategy over multiple iterations, minimizing these
  regrets over time. This process leads to strategies that converge towards a Nash equilibrium,
  where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. Variants include:

    - [CFR+]{.dfn} which aims to speed up convergence by preventing negative regrets [(Brown
    2017)](/research#Brown:2017){.subtle}
    - [MCCFR]{.dfn} which samples a subset of actions or trajectories through the game tree instead
    of updating all actions [(Lanctot 2009)](/research#Lanctot:2009){.subtle}
chance: |
  Elements within a game that are governed by random events outside the direct control of the
  players. The [Chance player]{.dfn} is a conceptual [player](#player) used to model these elements
  of uncertainty within the game and allows for the analysis of games where the outcomes depend not
  only on the choices of the players but also on elements of randomness. The [pkmn](#pkmn)
  [engine](https://pkmn.cc/engine) exposes APIs for inspecting or influencing chance when built with
  certain compile-time flags (`-Dchance` and `-Dcalc`, respectively).
client: |
  The code that communicates with the [server](#server) to enable a player to play the game. In
  standard Pokémon formats, the client only has a partial representation of one perspective of the
  actual battle state stored on the server. Clients connect to the server and exchange [public
  information](#information) with the server via a [protocol](#protocol).
conmeta: |
  A constructed [metagame](#metagame) (technically [format](#format)) where the artificially created
  rules have been arbitrarily tailored to simplify things for artificial intelligence agents
  (_e.g._, the [Shanai
  Cup](https://web.archive.org/web/20110706011535/http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?6273)).
consolidation: |
  Action consolidation is a technique for combining the results of actions with identical outcomes.
  Consolidation is similar to [transpositions](#transposition) in that they both involve
  [symmetry](#symmetry), with the difference being that consolidation allows for skipping similar
  work by leveraging past results whereas [transposition tables](#TT) allow for skipping work that
  has already been done. [Damage coalition](#damage-coalition) is a common form of consolidation in
  competitive Pokémon AI.
contempt: |
  The contempt factor reflects the estimated superiority / inferiority of the program over its
  opponent. Programs incorporating contempt may choose to follow different strategies against
  opponents of varying perceived skill level.
CSP: |
  Constraint satisfaction problems are mathematical problems where the goal is to find a set of
  values for variables that satisfy a specific set of constraints or restrictions. CSP solvers are
  algorithms or techniques designed to find solutions to these problems, often using methods like
  search, inference, and specialized heuristics to explore the space of possible variable
  assignments and identify the combinations that fulfill all the constraints.
  [OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) is a best-in-class open-source CSP solver.
cutoff: |
  The point at which search determines a particular branch of the game tree cannot possibly
  influence the final outcome and thus doesn't need to be explored further. In [negamax](#minimax)
  implementations of [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) search, all cutoffs are [beta-cutoffs]{.dfn} ---
  [fail-high](#failure-type) situations where the score backed up by the search is greater or equal
  to the upper bound β. [Move ordering](#move-ordering) helps to arrive at cutoffs as early as
  possible, minimizing the time wasted searching unimportant nodes.
damage calculator: |
  A program that determines the amount of HP a Pokémon will lose as a result of an opponent's
  damaging attack. The damage calculator or [calc]{.dfn} usually takes the form of a stripped-down
  [engine](#engine) that focuses entirely on the [damage
  formula](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage#Damage_calculation).
damage coalition: |
  A common form of [action consolidation](#consolidation) where damage [rolls](#roll) which produce
  the same results get combined. Damage rolls often result in the same outcome due to rounding or if
  the damage gets _capped_ due to causing a target to faint or breaking a
  [Substitute](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Substitute_(move)).
depth: |
  The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the [tree's](#game-tree) root node. A
  root node will have a depth of 0.
determinization: |
  A [simplification](#relaxation) technique where either a [stochastic](#stochastic) game is
  converted into a deterministic one or where various [perfect information](#information) states get
  sampled from the set of possible imperfect information states so that methods for solving perfect
  information games can be applied to games with imperfect information. The latter definition is
  more common, but unfortunately this technique has several weaknesses: the computational budget must
  be shared between the sampled perfect information games and various aspects of the search are
  often duplicated; _strategy fusion_, which occurs due to playing different strategies in different
  worlds when it has to find a unique strategy for all the worlds; and _non-locality_, which arises
  is from choosing locally optimal moves that are globally inferior.
dimensionality: |
  In the context of data analysis and [machine learning](#learning), dimensionality refers to the
  number of features (variables or attributes) that describe a data point whereas the
  [cardinality]{.dfn} refers to the number of values each feature can take on. High dimensionality
  and/or cardinality can lead to problems such as [combinatorial
  explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) and the [curse of
  dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) which renders certain
  approaches intractable, necessitating techniques such as [dimensionality
  reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), a form of
  [simplification](#relaxation).
drafting: |
  A component of certain Pokémon [variants](#variant) where players take turns choosing which
  Pokémon species will form their pool of available choices during a later
  [team-building](#team-building) component.
driver: |
  Code which operates / controls the [engine](#engine), perhaps to provide additional features or to
  allow for integration within a broader application.
EBC: |
  [Endless Battle Clause](https://dex.pokemonshowdown.com/articles/battlerules), a rule that exists
  in [Smogon University's](#Smogon) [formats](#format) to guarantee that all battles end in 1000
  turns or fewer, while also seeking to curtail certain specific degenerate strategies.
EE: |
  Extreme equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium where both players' strategies can't be described as
  convex combinations (weighted averages where the weights are non-negative and add up to 1) of
  other mixed strategies that form equilibria.
EEE: |
  Enumeration of [extreme equilibria](#EE), a [linear programming](#linear-programming) algorithm
  for determining all of the possible [Nash equilibrium](#NE) solutions in a [bimatrix
  game](#bimatrix-game) [(Avis 2010)](/research#Avis:2010){.subtle}.
EFG: |
  An [extensive-form game]{.dfn} is a specification of a [game](#game) allowing for the explicit
  representation of a number of key aspects, like the sequencing of players' possible moves, their
  choices at every [decision point](#turn), the (possibly imperfect) [information](#information)
  each player has about the other player's moves when they make a decision, and their
  [payoffs](#payoff) for all possible game outcomes. Extensive-form games also allow for the
  representation of incomplete information in the form of [chance events](#chance) modeled as _moves
  by nature_. Alternatives to the extensive-form game representation include the [normal-form]{.dfn}
  representation that simply boils the game down to a payoff [matrix](#bimatrix-game), or the
  [FOSG](#FOSG) representation.
eligibility trace: |
  An eligibility trace is a short-term memory mechanism in [reinforcement learning](#RL) that
  temporarily marks recently visited states or state-action pairs. When a reward is received, the
  eligibility trace determines which of these past experiences are eligible for learning updates,
  with recently visited states or actions having a stronger influence. This helps solve the problem
  of delayed rewards by bridging the gap between actions and their subsequent outcomes, leading to
  faster and more efficient learning.
Elo: |
  The Elo rating system, a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in [zero-sum
  games](#zero-sum). Notably, _not_ "ELO", as the Elo system is named after its creator, Arpad Elo.
embedding: |
  A relatively low-dimensional space into which high-dimensional vectors can be translated, ideally
  capturing some of the semantics of the input by placing semantically similar inputs close together
  in the embedding space. Usually [learned](#learning) and then used as input to a [neural
  network](#NN), examples of embeddings in Pokémon include
  [poke2vec](https://aliturfah.com/poke2vec/) and [pokemb](https://github.com/spktrm/pokemb).
emulator: |
  Code that's designed to mimic the outwardly observable behavior of both the hardware and software
  features of a real device, to allow for playing a Pokémon [cartridge](#cartridge) on arbitrary
  platforms.
endgame:
  Also known as the [lategame]{.dfn}, the final stage of the game, after the [midgame](#midgame). In
  competitive Pokémon, this stage of the game is far more tractable to solve given enough
  [information](#information) has usually been revealed such that the game effectively turns into
  one of perfect information, and certain common scenarios may have been exhaustively solved and
  encoded in a [precomputed](#offline) [endgame tablebase]{.dfn} ([EGTB]{.dfn}).
engine: |
  The core code responsible for implementing Pokémon battle mechanics. While multiple
  [engines](/concepts/engines) exist, without any other context the term _engine_ may also refer
  specifically to the [pkmn](#pkmn) [engine](https://pkmn.cc/engine).
EPOké: |
  A [pkmn](#pkmn) [client](#client) library that parses [protocol](#protocol) and builds up a
  representation of the perceived battle state ([information set](#information-set)) using
  [inference](#inference).
Exp3: |
  Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation, a [bandit](#bandit) algorithm
  commonly used in [tree bandit search](#TBS). Exp3 provides weaker theoretical guarantees with
  respect to convergence compared to [UCB](#UCB) though it is effective in practice and is
  well-suited to non-stationary environments where the best choice might change over time.
expectiminimax: |
  An extension of the [minimax](#minimax) algorithm to games of perfect but incomplete
  [information](#information) in which the outcome depends on a combination of the player's skill
  and [chance](#chance) elements.
exploitability: |
  A measure of the advantage an opponent can gain by deviating from their strategy to specifically
  counter the player's. Exploitability is important for assessing the quality of strategies ---
  strategies that are highly exploitable allow an opponent to significantly improve their outcome by
  exploiting the player's choices. [ε-exploitability]{.dfn} is a relaxed measure of exploitability
  that considers the best outcome an opponent can get while being at most ε away from their own
  [Nash equilibrium](#NE) payoff. ε-exploitability is much less computationally expensive to
  determine and can be more robust and realistic than traditional exploitability measures.
failure type: |
  [Alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) search often categorizes search failures into two groups:

  - [fail-low]{.dfn} is when a node in the search tree results in a score lower than the current
  best option (α in alpha-beta), meaning a minimizing player has a way of lowering the score even
  further and thus the rest of the node's branches can be ignored.
  - [fail-high]{.dfn} is when a node in the search tree results in a score higher than the current
  best option (β in [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta)), meaning a maximizing player has a way of improving
  the score even further and thus the rest of the node's branches can be skipped.

  However, if [aspiration windows](#aspiration-windows) are being used, these terms when applied to
  the root position imply a need to re-search with a wider window in order to get a true score
  instead of an upper or lower bound respectively.

  Failure terminology is also used in alpha-beta to describe the search approach:

  - [fail-hard]{.dfn} alpha-beta is a more traditional implementation of the algorithm where the
  return value of a search is strictly constrained within the α and β boundaries.
  - [fail-soft]{.dfn} alpha-beta allows the search to potentially return a value slightly outside of
  the alpha-beta window, potentially providing more information about the true value of the position
  (useful in combination with a [transposition table](#TT)) and generally the preferred method for
  modern search implementations).
format: |
  The set of rules and regulations that define the game being played. In Pokémon, the format
  determines the [generation](#generation) of play as well as which configurations and combinations
  of Pokémon are allowed. Format is often used interchangeably with [metagame](#metagame), though
  the latter actually refers to what's commonly seen in a format at a particular point in time
  (formats dictate what's allowed and metagames describe what popular strategies arise under those
  constraints).
FOSG: |
  A [factored-observation stochastic game]{.dfn} is a specification of a [game](#game) that builds
  on the concept of a partially observable stochastic game ([POSG]{.dfn}) from multi-agent
  [reinforcement learning](#RL) by dividing each agent's observations based on whether they
  represent public or private [information](#information) [(Kovařík
  2022)](/research#Kovařík:2022){.subtle}. Whereas an [information set](#information-set)
  representation is concerned with grouping indistinguishable game histories regardless of whether
  the hidden information is directly related to the environment or another player's knowledge, FOSGs
  explicitly factor observations into public and private components allowing for analysis
  specifically focused on how shared knowledge and private information shape an agent's perception
  of the game state.
FP: |
  An overloaded abbreviation that may refer to one of three things depending on context:

  -[Fictitious play]{.dfn}, a learning process where each player assumes their opponents are
  playing stationary (unchanging) strategies. During each round, a player calculates the best
  response to the historically observed actions of their opponents, believing those actions
  represent fixed strategies. This iterative process can lead players towards converging on a [Nash
  equilibrium](#NE) in certain types of games (like [zero-sum](#zero-sum) games), but it can fall
  short in settings where opponents actively adapt their strategies in response to the fictitious
  player's actions.
  - [Futility pruning]{.dfn}, an optimization technique used in game tree search algorithms like
  [minimax](#minimax) to improve efficiency. The basic idea is to stop evaluating a particular
  branch of the game tree if it becomes clear that the position is so poor for the current player
  that a better move is highly likely to exist elsewhere in the search space, even if it hasn't been
  explored yet. This is determined by comparing the position's current [evaluation](#value) to a
  static threshold value or a dynamically calculated margin.
  - the Pokémon move [Focus Punch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Focus_Punch_(move))
game: |
  Any set of circumstances that has a result dependent on the actions of two or more decision-makers
  ([players](#player)). In the context of competitive Pokémon battling, the _game_ or _battle_ can
  either be viewed as the combination of the [team-building](#team-building) and
  [piloting](#piloting) components (and sometimes even featuring an initial [drafting](#drafting)
  component) or simply the piloting aspect. In most cases, without additional qualifiers the _game_
  can usually be understood to refer exclusively to the piloting component.
game tree: |
  A graph representing all possible game [states](#state) within a [game](#game). The [complete game
  tree]{.dfn} for a game is the game tree starting at the initial state and containing all possible
  [moves](#action) from each state and is equivalent to the tree obtained from the [extensive-form
  game](#EFG) representation). Given that it's usually intractable to enumerate the entire game tree
  in Pokémon, AI agents usually search over a [partial game tree]{.dfn} which contains a subset of
  the nodes from the complete game tree.
generation: |
  A grouping of Pokemon game releases that separate them based on the Pokémon and mechanics they
  include. Generations are typically referred to by acronyms based on their release titles:

    1. _Generation I_: RBY, RB, RBG
    2. _Generation II_: GSC, GS
    3. _Generation III_: ADV, RSE, RS, RSEFRLG
    4. _Generation IV_: DPP, DPPt, DP, HGSS, DPPtHGSS
    5. _Generation V_: BW, BW2, B2W2
    6. _Generation VI_: XY, ORAS
    7. _Generation VII_: SM, USUM
    8. _Generation VIII_: SS, SwSh
    9. _Generation IX_: SV
genetic algorithm: |
  Genetic algorithms ([GA]{.dfn}) are a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained
  optimization problems that are based on [natural
  selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection). Genetic algorithms are typically
  useful when the objective function is discontinuous, non-differentiable,
  [stochastic](#stochastic), or highly nonlinear, and are often used to determine the values of
  [hyperparameters](#hyperparameter).
GF: |
  [Game Freak](https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/), primary developer and co-owner of Pokémon, responsible
  for the [cartridge](#cartridge) implementation.
GGP: |
  General Game Playing is a field within artificial intelligence that focuses on creating systems
  capable of learning and playing a wide variety of games without being explicitly programmed for
  each specific one.  A GGP system is provided with the rules of a game in a formal language (like
  the Game Description Language) and must learn to play effectively through self-play, analysis, and
  strategy adaptation. The goal of GGP is to develop intelligent agents that can reason about new
  game situations, demonstrating a level of flexibility that surpasses AI programs specialized for
  single games like chess or Go.
gimmick:
  Sometimes used to describe an unorthodox and usually suboptimal Pokémon set, more commonly used to
  refer to [generational gimmicks]{.dfn} which are novel mechanics which have been introduced to
  certain Pokémon [generations](#generation) which alter which [actions](#action) are possible.
  Generational gimmicks include [Mega
  Evolution](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Evolution),
  [Z-Moves](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Z-Move),
  [Dynamax](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dynamax), and
  [Terastallization](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Terastal_phenomenon).
Glicko: |
  The Glicko rating system, a method used by [Pokémon Showdown](#PS) to assess a player's strength.
  Used primarily for [usage stats](#usage-stats).
GXE: |
  [Glicko X-Act Estimate or _GLIXARE_](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/51169/), an estimate
  used by [Pokémon Showdown](#PS) of a player's win chance against an average player.
HCE: |
  Hand-crafted evaluation --- a [evaluation function](#value) written manually (as opposed to
  learned), often leveraging [heuristics](#heuristic) or other [rule-based](#rule-based) approaches.
heuristic: |
  An approach for arriving at a solution by trial and error or by [rules](#rule) that are only
  loosely defined via methods which aren't optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless
  sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation.
history heuristic: |
  A dynamic [move ordering](#move-ordering) technique that works by keeping track of how often a
  particular move has caused [cutoffs](#cutoff) in previous searches, irrespective of the state
  in which the move had been made. Moves that have historically caused a high number of cutoffs are
  prioritized early in the search, under the assumption that they are more likely to lead to good
  positions and cause cutoffs again. To apply to competitive Pokémon AIs, logical or contextual
  [inputs](#input-log) are usually required.
horizon effect: |
  A problem that arises in [depth](#depth)-limited search algorithms where positions can be
  inaccurately assessed in circumstances where important consequences occur just beyond the search
  horizon (_e.g._, when facing an opponent's move that can cause serious damage and is ultimately
  unavoidable but which can be temporarily avoided by the use of delaying tactics). Strategies for
  combating this include [quiescence search](#quiescence-search) or increasing the search depth for
  certain moves ([extensions]{.dfn}).
hyperparameter: |
  A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast,
  the values of other parameters (typically node weights) are derived via training.
inference: |
  The process of drawing conclusions from evidence and reasoning. Inferences go beyond the
  explicitly stated information, using prior knowledge, experience, and logic to reach a likely or
  plausible conclusion. [Deduction]{.dfn} is a form of inference where the conclusions are logically
  guaranteed given a set of premises.
information: |
  All the [knowledge](#knowledge) and [observations](#observation) available to players at any given
  point in a game (_e.g_, the [rules](#format), the current [state](#state), and the past
  [actions](#action)).

  [Hidden information]{.dfn} refers to any aspect of the game state that's not directly observable
  by all players. Games where some information is hidden from at least one player are considered to
  have [imperfect information]{.dfn}, in contrast to [perfect information]{.dfn} games.

  A [complete information]{.dfn} game is one where all players know the rules, the
  [payoffs](#payoff) of each possible outcome and the strategies available to everyone whereas in an
  [incomplete information]{.dfn} game at least one player lacks knowledge about some aspect of the
  game rules, payoffs, or another player's strategy space. Complete information deals with game
  structure and payoffs whereas perfect information deals with game state --- it is possible that a
  game's information may be perfect but incomplete or complete and imperfect.

  [Public information]{.dfn} is knowledge shared by all players whereas [private information]{.dfn}
  is knowledge held by only a single player. Private information is necessarily hidden but not all
  hidden information is private as it may refer to information known by a subset of more than one
  player or be completely unknown to all participants.
information set: |
  An information set ([IS]{.dfn}) is the set of all possible [actions](#action) in the game for a
  given player, built on their [observations](#observation) and a set for a particular player that,
  given what that player has observed, shows the decision vertices available to the player which are
  indistinguishable to them at the current point in the game. All nodes within an information set
  represent situations where the player has observed the same sequence of actions, despite
  potentially different hidden moves being made by their opponents.
input log: |
  A log that tracks every input that has been made throughout a battle, where an [input]{.dfn}
  encodes the [action](#action) taken by a player. However, there are several potential ways this
  input can be encoded:

    - [raw input]{.dfn} simply encodes the action type and [slot](#slot) (and optionally the
    target) (_e.g._, `switch 4` or `move 1 2 mega`). This form is ultimately required by an
    [engine](#engine) to unambiguously implement the battle mechanics of Pokémon.
    - [logical input]{.dfn} is an encoding where move or species names are used in lieu of slots,
    (_e.g._, `switch zapdos` or `move thunderbolt`). This encoding is more intuitive and often more
    useful to work with when utilizing [machine learning](#learning) techniques, though isn't
    accepted by all engines and can be ambiguous (_e.g._, in [formats](#format) without the [Species
    Clause](https://www.smogon.com/xy/articles/clauses)).
    - [contextual input]{.dfn} is a class of inputs that add additional context to a logical input
    about the scenario the input was made in to provide necessary information for
    [learning](#learning) algorithms (_e.g._, `Zapdos Thunderbolt vs. Starmie` or `Zapdos -> Starmie
    vs. Rhydon`).

  Applying anchored subsets of the input log to the initial battle state can be used to recompute
  past battle states, and competitive Pokémon developers may choose to improve memory overhead by
  storing the game tree in terms of an initial state and inputs as opposed to storing copies of
  battle state at each node.
interior equilibria: |
  A [mixed Nash equilibrium](#NE) where all players play each of their available strategies with a
  positive probability --- _i.e._, no player puts all their weight on any single strategy. Interior
  equilibria are often more stable than non-interior equilibria because they're less likely to be
  disrupted by small changes in the game's [payoffs](#payoff). This is because if one player
  deviates from an interior equilibrium by playing a different strategy with a small probability,
  the other player won't have a strong incentive to change their strategy in response.
iterative deepening: |
  A technique where a [depth](#depth)-limited search algorithm is performed multiple times with the
  depth increased with each iteration. While originally used as a form of timer management to allow
  these searches to work in an [online](#anytime) context, iterative deepening can actually be
  faster in [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) than simply searching a given depth immediately due to
  information obtained from previous searches having beneficial effects methods such as the [history
  heuristic](#history-heuristic) can have on [move ordering](#move-ordering).
iterative distillation: |
  A knowledge distillation technique where a smaller student [model](#model) is [trained](#learning)
  on the outputs of a larger, more complex teacher model, and this process is repeated multiple
  times. In each iteration, a new student is trained and distilled from the previous (now more
  capable) student. The outputs of this new student may be further improved through an optional
  [amplification]{.dfn} step aimed at boosting the capabilities of the student model beyond simply
  mirroring the previous student's outputs before serving as the training target for the next
  iteration. This chain of distillation and amplification leads to successively smaller and more
  accurate student models, transferring knowledge without directly using the original training data.
joint action: |
  The combination of [actions](#action) chosen by all players in a [simultaneous move](#SM)
  [game](#game). An individual player's action is not sufficient to determine an outcome in a
  simultaneous move game --- all players' actions are required and each possible combination of
  actions may result in different [payoffs](#payoff) for each player.
killer move: |
  A [move ordering](#move-ordering) [heuristic](#heuristic) that optimizes search by prioritizing
  evaluating highly advantageous moves that dramatically limit an opposing player's response options
  (_e.g._, a move that causes an opposing Pokémon to faint, possibly winning the battle).
knowledge: |
  Knowledge is the possession of [information](#information). Knowledge can refer to an _a priori_
  understanding of a game's mechanics and rules; can be encoded as [heuristics](#heuristic) or
  within an [evaluation function](#value), or can be [learned](#learning) procedurally.
Lc0: |
  [Leela Chess Zero](https://lczero.org/), an open-source computer chess agent based on the design
  behind [AlphaGo](#AlphaGo). Regularly competes with [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) for
  the title of strongest computer chess agent.
lead: |
  The Pokémon on a player's team that's sent out first at the beginning of the battle (sometimes
  predetermined during [team-building](#team-building) though otherwise determined in [Team
  Preview](#Team-Preview)).
learning: |
  Learning refers to machine learning ([ML]{.dfn}), where statistical algorithms are leveraged to
  generalize and perform tasks without explicit instructions. The three main categories of machine
  learning are:

    1. [supervised learning]{.dfn}, where both example inputs and their desired outputs are provided
    2. [unsupervised learning]{.dfn}, only the inputs are provided, and
    3. [[reinforcement learning](#RL)]{.dfn}, where an agent aims to perform a certain goal and is
    given feedback along the way that it attempts to maximize
Libratus:
  The first computer agent to achieve superhuman performance in [no-limit Texas hold 'em
  poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), using a new variant of [counterfactual regret
  minimization](#CFR) dubbed CFR+ [(Brown 2017)](/research#Brown:2017){.subtle}. Libratus was later
  followed by Modicum [(Brown 2018)](/research#Brown:2018){.subtle}, Pluribus [(Brown
  2019)](/research#Brown:2019){.subtle}, and ReBeL [(Brown 2020)](/research#Brown:2020){.subtle} ---
  state-of-the-art agents which are similarly foundational as [AlphaGo](#AlphaGo) but for imperfect
  information games.
linear programming: |
  Linear programming ([LP]{.dfn}), also called linear optimization, is a method to achieve the best
  outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are
  represented by linear relationships. Typically used in competitive Pokémon AI research to solve
  for the [Nash equilibrium](#NE).
LLM: |
  Large language models are [machine learning](#learning) [models](#model) built with
  [transformers](#transformer) that are trained on massive amounts of data and can be used to
  recognize and generate text.
LMR: |
  Late move reductions are an optimization for search that involves reducing the search
  [depth](#depth) of moves that have been [ordered](#move-ordering) closer to the end of possible
  moves for a given state (as opposed to [pruning](#pruning) such moves). Search on these late moves
  can be re-run with the full depth if they end up proving promising.
look-ahead: |
  The [depth](#depth) that a search algorithm searches to.
LOS: |
  The likelihood of superiority denotes how likely it would be for two players of the same strength
  to reach a certain result --- in other fields called a p-value, a measure of the statistical
  significance of a departure from the null hypothesis.
lrsnash: |
  A linear programming algorithm for determining all of the possible [Nash equilibrium](#NE)
  solutions in a [bimatrix game](#bimatrix-game) published in [(Avis
  2010)](/research#Avis:2010){.subtle} and available in the
  [`lrslib`](https://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrs.html).
match-up: |
  Match-up (or [MU]{.dfn}) describes the advantage (or disadvantage) of a given team or Pokémon
  against another team or Pokémon. In the context of teams or the battle as a whole, match-up
  determines which team is favored to win after [team-building](#team-building), and often the
  advantage may be strongly in favor of one side.
matrix node: |
  In [simultaneous move](#SM) games, a matrix node represents a specific combination of actions
  chosen by all players. Each node in the game's [matrix representation](#bimatrix-game) corresponds
  to an outcome of the game.
MaxDamagePlayer:
  A simple competitive Pokémon playing [agent](#agent) that chooses to use whichever `move` action
  is expected to do the most damage the [next turn](#OTL) to the opponent, commonly seen in the
  [literature](/projects) alongside the [$`RandomPlayer`](#RandomPlayer) when benchmarking / testing
  agents due to its simplicity of implementation. Certain variants of this exist depending on how
  much of the [damage formula](#damage-calculator) is implemented, with the simplest versions of
  $`MaxDamagePlayer` perhaps only considering each move's effective base power after [STAB](#STAB)
  and type effectiveness. A fully featured $`MaxDamagePlayer` can achieve a much higher level of
  play than a $`RandomPlayer`, though is extremely [exploitable](#exploitability) (this can be
  somewhat mitigated by the addition of some randomness or certain [heuristics](#heuristic)).
MCTS: |
  [Monte Carlo tree search]{.dfn} is a [heuristic](#heuristic) search algorithm that combines tree
  search with the Monte Carlo method, a broad class of algorithms that rely on repeated random
  sampling to obtain results. MCTS is particularly useful for games with large decision spaces and
  imperfect information. The algorithm works by iteratively building a search tree where each node
  represents a possible game [state](#state), and edges represent [actions](#action). MCTS
  selectively expands the tree, guided by simulations (random [playouts](#playout)) that estimate
  the value of taking different actions from each state. This combination of strategic exploration
  and value estimation allows MCTS to find strong moves even in complex games like Go, where it's
  impossible to evaluate every possible move.
MDP: |
  A [Markov decision process]{.dfn} is a [stochastic](#stochastic) decision-making process that uses
  a mathematical framework to model the decision-making of a dynamic system in scenarios where the
  results are either random or controlled by a decision-maker, which makes sequential decisions over
  time. In competitive Pokémon AI research, _MDP_ may also refer to the
  [$`MaxDamagePlayer`](#MaxDamagePlayer) in certain contexts.
metagame: |
  Also known as the [meta]{.dfn}, describes the most popular strategies and approaches to playing a
  game. In competitive Pokémon, [usage stats](#usage-stats) provide information to determine which
  Pokémon define a particular [format's](#format) metagame.
metaheuristic: |
  A higher-level, problem-independent procedure or framework that outlines strategies to guide the
  design of heuristic optimization algorithms. Examples include [genetic
  algorithms](#genetic-algorithm), simulated annealing, and Tabu search.
midgame: |
  Term to describe everything that happens between the early game [opening](#opening) and the
  [endgame](#endgame).
minimax:
  Also known as [maximin]{.dfn}, describes the concept of minimizing the possible loss for a worst-
  case (maximum loss) scenario. Usually refers to the minimax [search](#search) algorithm, a
  recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game such that each player makes the
  move that maximizes the minimum [value](#value) of the position resulting from the opponent's
  possible moves. Furthermore, due to competitive Pokémon being a [stochastic](#stochastic) game,
  minimax is often actually referring to the [expectiminimax](#expectiminimax) algorithm.
  [Negamax]{.dfn} is a particularly common way of implementing minimax --- instead of using two
  separate functions for the minimizing and maximizing player respectively it passes on a negated
  score such that $`max(a, b) = -min(-a, -b)`.
model: |
  A simplified mathematical representation of a system or process based on observed data patterns
  that can be used to make predictions or decisions on new data. [Model-based]{.dfn} approaches to
  machine learning learn a representation of how the environment works and how [actions](#action)
  lead to [state](#state) changes whereas [model-free]{.dfn} approaches learn purely through trial
  and error and focus directly on learning the [policy](#policy).
move: |
  See [action](#action).
move ordering:
  The process of determining the sequence in which potential moves should be considered during a
  game tree search. Good move ordering is crucial for the efficiency of search algorithms like
  [minimax](#minimax) or [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) pruning, as exploring the most promising moves
  first can lead to more frequent [cutoffs](#cutoff), allowing the algorithm to [prune](#pruning)
  irrelevant sections of the search tree and reach deeper evaluations more quickly. Move ordering
  techniques often involve a mix of [heuristics](#heuristic), static move [evaluations](#value),
  and domain-specific knowledge.
MVP: |
  The [minimal viable product]{.dfn}, a version with the bare-minimum number of features to be
  usable / demonstrate enough of a solution that feedback becomes relevant.
NE: |
   The [Nash equilibrium]{.dfn}, a stable state of a system involving the interaction of different
   participants, in which no participant can gain by a unilateral change of [strategy](#strategy) if
   the strategies of the others remain unchanged. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium or mixed Nash
   equilibrium ([MNE]{.dfn}) is a Nash equilibrium tgat requires a mixed strategy (a probability
   distribution over pure strategies), and every n-player game has at least one mixed Nash
   equilibrium. In competitive Pokémon, Nash equilibrium is used interchangeably with mixed Nash
   equilibrium.
NMH: |
  The null move heuristic (alternatively [null move pruning]{.dfn}) is a [pruning](#pruning)
  technique in [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) search where the agent performs a reduced-[depth](#depth)
  search on a null move (the equivalent of passing in Pokémon in circumstances that would not
  normally allow for a pass). Based on the observation that in most cases there is almost always a
  better alternative to doing nothing, if the score after the null move is still higher than or
  equal to β (the minimum score the opponent can force), it indicates the position is already
  strong for the current player and a [cutoff](#cutoff) would likely occur even with a real move.
  This allows the algorithm to identify cutoffs with less computational effort.
NN: |
  A [neural network]{.dfn}, is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system,
  comprised of multiple layers of _nodes_, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and
  an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight
  and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that
  node is [activated](#activation-function), sending data to the next layer of the network.
  Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
NNUE: |
  An [efficiently updatable [neural network](#NN)]{.dfn}, stylized _ƎUИИ_, an architecture intended
  to replace the [evaluation function](#value) of [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta) searches running on a
  CPU via [SIMD](#SIMD) instructions. [Originally developed for Computer
  Shogi](https://github.com/asdfjkl/nnue/blob/main/nnue_en.pdf), NNUE has been used successfully in
  chess engines such as [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) to achieve high ratings.
node type: |
  Search tree nodes in [alpha-beta search](#alpha-beta) are often classified into one of three
  types. These types are then stored in a [transition table](#TT) which indicates whether the score
  (an approximation of the nodes [value](#value)) for a node is exact, lower or upper bounded.

  1. [PV-nodes]{.dfn} (or Type 1 nodes) have a score that lies between the α (lower) and β (upper)
  bounds. These nodes all have moves searched and the value returned is exact, which propagates up
  to the root along with a [principal variation](#PV).
  2. [Cut-nodes]{.dfn} (also know as Type 2 or [fail-high](#failure-type) nodes) are nodes in which a
  [beta-cutoff](#cutoff) was performed. A minimum of one move of a cut-node needs to be searched and
  the score returned is a lower bound on the exact score of the node.
  3. [All-nodes]{.dfn} (also known as Type 3 or fail-low nodes) are nodes in which no move's score
  exceeded α. Every move of this type of node is searched and the score returned is an upper
  bound on the exact score.
null window: |
  An [alpha-beta search](#alpha-beta) window defined with a very narrow range ($`\alpha = \beta -
  1`) to test whether a move will cause a [cutoff](#cutoff). This test is based on the idea that if
  a move doesn't cause a cutoff within this narrow window, it's highly unlikely to cause a cutoff
  with a wider window and therefore the rest of the search can be skipped. Null window searches are
  the foundation of techniques like [Principal Variation Search](#PV).
observation: |
  Information that is produced when the [state](#state) [transitions](#transition). In Pokémon, this
  may include a result that can be used to determine [payoff](#payoff) and possible legal
  [actions](#action), _logs_ which detail various events that may have occurred, an account of the
  [chance](#chance) actions, or a multitude of other possibilities depending on the
  [engine](#engine).
offline: |
  An offline algorithm receives all input data upfront and is required to output a solution that
  addresses the entire problem. If something can be done _offline_ that usually means that it can be
  precomputed ahead of time, as opposed to in the middle of a game (contrast to [online](#online)).
online: |
   An online algorithm is one that can serially process its input piece-by-piece, _i.e._, in the
   order that the input is fed to the algorithm, without having the entire input available from the
   start (contrast to [offline](#offline)).
opening: |
  The beginning of the game (sometimes referred to as the [early game]{.dfn}). In Pokémon, this
  consists of the [Team Preview](#Team-Preview) in generations where it exists as well as the first
  few turns of the initial [lead](#lead) [match-up](#match-up). Followed by the [midgame](#midgame).
  Many [agents](#agent) leverage an [opening book]{.dfn} which is a [precomputed](#offline)
  [policy](#policy) for handling play at this stage of the game.
opponent modeling: |
  The process of building a representation of an opponent's strategies, preferences, and potential
  actions in a competitive environment. This model can be built through [observation](#observation)
  of the opponent's behavior, historical data, and by [inferring](#inference) their goals. An
  opponent model allows a player to proactively adjust strategies based on their understanding of
  the opponent's tendencies and weaknesses and is an important factor in [predicting](#prediction)
  an opponent's actions.
oracle: |
  A hypothetical black box or subroutine that can instantly solve a specific problem or answer a
  question, often with perfect accuracy. These are used in theoretical analysis to understand the
  limits of what can be computed and to compare the complexity of different algorithms. The term is
  also used less theoretically in [machine-learning](#learning) to refer to the source of ground
  truth labels or correct answers for supervised learning.

  The [double-oracle]{.dfn} method refers to a particular algorithm for solving [simultaneous move
  alpha-beta search](#alpha-beta) [(Bošanský 2013)](/research#Bošanský:2013){.subtle}.
OTL: |
  One-[turn](#turn) [look-ahead](#look-ahead). The [$`MaxDamagePlayer`](#MaxDamagePlayer) is the
  conventional name for an agent that leverages only a single turn of look-ahead. _$`N`TL_ can be
  used to generalize this shorthand for describing the [depth](#depth) an agent searches to (_e.g._,
  _3TL_ for three turns worth of look-ahead).
pathology: |
  Game tree pathology is a phenomenon where searching a [game tree](#game-tree) [deeper](#depth)
  results in worse decisions.
payoff: |
  The reward a player receives from arriving at a particular outcome. In Pokémon, only the terminal
  states give rewards, where the reward is determined based on the result of the battle (winning,
  losing or drawing --- though pedantically, Pokémon glitches mean that one also needs to support
  the notion of a battle ending in _error_ which can usually be mapped to a draw) and the
  utility / reward function (which usually maps [W/L/T](#WLT) to `1/-1/0` making Pokémon a
  [zero-sum](#zero-sum) game or `1/0/0.5` making Pokémon a [constant-sum](#zero-sum) game, the
  latter being more common).
PBS: |
  A [public belief state]{.dfn} is a probability distribution over all possible hidden states of the
  game, based on the [information](#information) that's shared by all players. PBSs allow players to
  reason about what others might know and make decisions based on the likelihood of different
  scenarios, even when they don't have complete information about the game's true state.
perspective: |
  Perspective or [viewpoint]{.dfn} determines which information in Pokémon is available. Perspective
  can refer to a specific [player](#player) or side, or can be one of two special perspectives ---
  the [omniscient perspective]{.dfn} which is aware of all information from both sides and the
  [spectator perspective]{.dfn} which is aware of all [public information](#information) but none of
  the private information of either player.
piloting: |
  The component of competitive Pokémon that involves playing out a battle [online](#online) _after_
  each players' teams have already been chosen.
Pinyon: |
  A [C++ library](https://github.com/baskuit/pinyon) that builds on top of [`lrslib`](#lrsnash) and
  provides a collection of search and planning utilities for simultaneous move stochastic games.
  Pinyon includes a state-of-the-art version of simultaneous move alpha-beta search using the
  double-oracle method [(Bošanský 2013)](/research#Bošanský:2013){.subtle} modified with support for
  stochastic games as well as a generalized implementation of [tree-bandit search](#TBS) with
  [Exp3](#Exp3).
pkmn: |
  A common abbreviation of Pokémon dating back to the earliest releases where the stylized
  ^P^~K~^M^~N~ was included in the [cartridge](#cartridge) character set. However, this abbreviation
  has since been adopted as the name for the [pkmn](https://pkmn.cc) collection of projects (notably
  the pkmn [engine](#engine), [`libpkmn`](https://pkmn.cc/engine)) and is often what's being
  referenced (and is always what's being referred to when prefixed with an _@_, as @pkmn is the name
  of the [organization](https://pkmn.cc/@pkmn)).
player: |
  A strategic decision-maker within the context of the game. In Pokémon, these are usually referred
  to as _Player 1_ and _Player 2_ (alternatively, _P1_ / _P2_ or _Player A_ / _Player B_) and are
  technically not completely [symmetrical](#symmetry) because certain game mechanics depend on the
  notion of the _host_ player (conventionally P1). In more general terms, either P1 or P2 may be
  considered the _player_ vs. the _enemy_ / _foe_ depending on [perspective](#perspective) --- the
  P1 vs. P2 distinction is absolute whereas the less specific player vs. foe terminology is
  relative. When considering Pokémon as a [bimatrix game](#bimatrix-game) the _row player_ and
  _column player_ are usually also used to refer to relative perspectives.
playout: |
  The act of playing out the rest of the game from a particular node in the [game tree](#game-tree).
  The term playout or rollout is sometimes confusingly used as a shorthand to describe a single
  iteration of a [tree bandit search](#TBS) algorithm over the tree (_i.e._, the entire process of
  selection / expansion / simulation / backpropagation) as opposed to describing just the simulation
  phase. Furthermore, playouts may sometimes not actually involve playing out to a terminal node if
  an [evaluation function](#value) is used instead. Playouts may be classified as light (faster,
  shallower, relying on simpler evaluation functions and focusing on exploration) or heavy (slower,
  deeper, more accurate, and featuring stronger evaluation)
PoG:
  Player of Games, the original name of a general game-playing agent that utilized improved
  [counterfactual regret minimization](#CFR) to achieve superhuman performance in a variety of games
  [(Schmid 2021)](/research#Schmid:2021){.subtle}.
policy: |
  A [state](#state) to [action](#action) mapping --- for each action possible from a given state, a
  policy returns the probability of taking the action. Ultimately, the objective of a competitive
  Pokémon AI is to determine the optimal policy for any given state. [Reinforcement learning](#RL)
  aims to accomplish this by learning a [policy network]{.dfn}.
POMDP: |
  Partially observable Markov decision process, a generalization of a [Markov decision
  process](#MDP) which models an agent decision process in which it's assumed that the system
  dynamics are determined by an MDP, but the agent can't directly [observe](#observation) the
  underlying [state](#state).
pondering: |
  The act of thinking during an opponent's turn. Given that Pokémon is a [simultaneous move](#SM)
  game, pondering occurs after a player has submitted their action (or been asked to wait) while
  they're waiting for their next opportunity to input an action.
PPO: |
  Proximal Policy Optimization is a [model-free](#model) [reinforcement learning](#RL) policy
  gradient algorithm offering a solid combination of stability, efficiency, and performance that
  aims to increase the probability of actions leading to higher rewards by directly optimizing the
  policy itself.
prediction: |
  An estimate of something that will happen in the future. In competitive Pokémon, a prediction
  usually refers to a player's expectation of their opponent's next [action](#action), though
  players also make predictions about any and all unknown information.
ProbCut: |
  A [selective](#selectivity) search enhancement for algorithms like [alpha-beta
  search](#alpha-beta) that's based on the idea that the result of a shallow search can be used to
  predict the results of deeper searches. ProbCut uses linear regression to model the relationship
  between shallow and deeper search values, allowing it to identify branches of the search tree that
  are unlikely to affect the final outcome and therefore can be [pruned](#pruning), improving search
  efficiency.
protocol: |
  The format and rules governing how [clients](#client) communicate with the [server](#server).
  Different [simulators](#sim) / [engines](#engine) have their own protocols and there is no single
  standard, though the vast majority of competitive Pokémon agents adhere to the [Pokémon
  Showdown](#PS) [protocol](/concepts/protocol).
pruning: |
  A name for every heuristic that removes completely certain branches of the search tree, assuming
  they have no bearing on the search result. Backward pruning where the decision on what to prune
  happens after finding a refutation while searching (_e.g._ [Alpha-beta](#alpha-beta)) is sound and
  will never affect the search result --- forward pruning which preemptively eliminates branches
  before searching comes with the risk of potentially overlooking something. Compare to
  [reduction](#reduction).
PS: |
  [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com), the most popular and influential Pokemon battle
  [simulator](#sim).
PV: |
  The principal variation is a sequence of moves that programs consider best and therefore expect to
  be played. [Principal Variation Search (PVS)]{.dfn} is an enhancement to [alpha-beta](#alpha-beta)
  search that focuses computational effort by assuming the principal variation found in a previous,
  shallower search will likely remain the best at the current depth; therefore, nodes within the
  principal variation are searched deeply, while other nodes are searched with a narrow
  [fail-soft](#failure-type) window to quickly determine if they can potentially outperform the
  current best move.
Q-learning: |
  A model-free [reinforcement learning](#RL) algorithm to learn the value of an [action](#action) in
  a particular [state](#state) that can handle problems with [stochastic](#stochastic)
  [transitions](#transition) and [rewards](#payoff) without requiring adaptations. Q-learning was
  used by DeepMind in their Deep Q-Network ([DQN]{.dfn}) algorithm along with a technique called
  experience replay to solve a wide range of Atari games [(Mnih
  2015)](/research#Mnih:2015){.subtle}.
quiescence search: |
  A technique used to improve the accuracy of position evaluations at leaf nodes (positions where no
  further moves are being generated). It specifically focuses on volatile positions where
  significant [value](#value) changes may occur in the immediate next moves (eg. due to knocking out
  an opponent's Pokémon). The idea is to extend the search [depth](#depth) selectively only in these
  volatile positions until a relatively stable [queiscent]{.dfn} position is reached, preventing
  premature [cutoffs](#cutoff) due to the [horizon effect](#horizon-effect) and leading to a more
  reliable evaluation.
RandomPlayer: |
  Also known as [RP]{.dfn}, a trivial competitive Pokémon playing [agent](#agent) that leverages
  some version of a [uniform policy](#uniform-policy), commonly seen in the [literature](/projects)
  alongside the [$`MaxDamagePlayer`](#MaxDamagePlayer) when benchmarking/ testing agents due to its
  simplicity of implementation. However, despite this seemingly simple definition, multiple subtly
  different versions of the $`RandomPlayer` exist (_e.g._, many implementations decide to _choose_
  only `move` actions unless forced to _consider_ `switch` actions, and may have similar
  [heuristics](#heuristic) for decided how to treat generational [gimmicks](#gimmick)). While all
  $`RandomPlayer` implementations are forced to choose `move` or `switch` actions when they're the
  only option available, nuances between implementations exist in the common scenario where either
  type of action is possible.

  Formally, the notation $`RandomPlayer(N\%)` should be used to refer to an agent which $`N\%` of
  the time uniformly chooses to make a `switch` action when available, otherwise choosing uniformly
  between possible `move` actions. $`RandomPlayer(\widetilde{N\%})` instead always considers
  available `move` actions but only considers `switch` actions $`N\%` of the time unless forced.
  This distinction of choosing uniformly between a minimal subset of the action space or considering
  potentially multiple subsets of the space can be extended to gimmicks such as `mega`, `zmove`,
  `dynamax` or `terastallize`, though in those cases a more explicit notation is preferred (_e.g._,
  $`RandomPlayer(switch=\widetilde{20\%}, zmove=90\%)` would consider `switch` 20% of the time and
  use `zmove` when available 90% of the time).
reduction: |
  A class of search heuristics that decrease the [depth](#depth) to which a certain branch of the
  tree is searched. Compare to [pruning](#pruning).
regret: |
  The [value](#value) of the difference between a possible (usually optimal) [action](#action) and
  the action that has actually been chosen. The key concept underpinning [counterfactual regret
  minimization](#CFR).
relaxation: |
  An approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that's easier to solve. A solution to
  the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem.
reverse damage calculator: |
  A tool that computes information about a Pokémon's set (ability, item, spread ranges) based on the
  amount of damage its moves inflict on its opponents. The inverse of a [damage
  calculator](#damage-calculator).
reward shaping: |
  A technique used in [reinforcement learning](#RL) where small intermediate rewards are given to
  the algorithm to help reshape [sparse](#sparse) reward functions to denser ones to help the
  algorithm converge more quickly.
RNG:
  A random number generator, though almost always in the context of competitive Pokémon this refers
  to a pseudo-random number generator ([PRNG]{.dfn}). The term RNG can also simply refer to random
  events in general. RNGs usually produce a stream of random numbers that depend on the initial
  starting state of the generator, known as its [seed]{.seed}.
RL: |
  Reinforcement learning is a form of [machine learning](#learning) where an [agent](#agent) learns
  to take actions to maximize a cumulative reward. [Q-learning](#Q-learning), [PPO](#PPO), and
  [Actor-Critic](#SAC) are three common reinforcement learning algorithms.
roll: |
  A colloquial term describing a [chance](#chance) event --- the result from invoking the [random
  number generator](#RNG). The roll concept is generalized from that of a dice roll. In Pokémon, a
  [damage roll]{.dfn} is one of many possible damage values that result from the step in the [damage
  formula](#damage-calculator) that applies a random factor to the base computed damage of most
  attacking moves. See also [damage coalition](#damage-coalition).
rollout: |
  See [playout](#playout). [Rollout](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rollout_(move)) is also
  the name of a Pokémon move.
rule: |
  One of a set of explicit or understood regulations or principles governing conduct within a
  particular activity or sphere. The rules of competitive Pokémon are dictated by the
  [format](#format) --- there are a wide variety of possible classes of [custom
  rules](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/config/CUSTOM-RULES.md) which may
  apply. The term can also refer to a rule from a [rule-based](#rule-based) agent.
rule-based: |
  A system that applies human-made [rules](#rule) to store, sort and manipulate data as opposed to
  rules discovered via machine [learning](#learning). These systems typically take the forum of
  `if-then` statements and involve [hand-crafted evaluation](#HCE) functions.
SAC: |
  Soft Actor-Critic is a method of augmenting the traditional actor-critic [reinforcement
  learning](#RL) algorithm to favor policies with higher entropy, improving exploration early on.
  The Actor-Critic algorithm makes use of two different components (usually two separate [neural
  networks](#NN)) --- an Actor that learns the policy and a Critic that learns how good actions
  are in a given state.
search: |
  The process of exploring the possible decision paths and outcomes within a game to identify strong
  strategies or solutions. Search algorithms systematically evaluate different [actions](#action)
  and their potential consequences, often building a search tree where nodes represent game
  [states](#state) and branches represent possible moves. The goal of search is to find optimal or
  near-optimal strategies, considering factors like [payoffs](#payoff), uncertainty, and the actions
  of other players.
selectivity: |
  A search algorithm's ability to discriminate between promising and unpromising moves or areas of
  the search space (_i.e._, those likely to become part of the [principal variation](#PV)). A highly
  selective algorithm is better at focusing its computational effort on the most relevant parts of
  the problem, quickly identifying strong candidate solutions, and effectively reducing or
  [pruning](#pruning) irrelevant branches.
self-play: |
  A technique where a game-playing [agent](#agent) plays against itself repeatedly in order to
  generate data and improve the agent's strategies without the need for a human opponent. During
  self-play, the agent [learns](#learning) from both its successes and failures, gradually refining
  its decision-making abilities within the game environment.
sequentialization: |
  Sometimes called [serialization]{.dfn}, sequentialization refers to the process of transforming a
  [simultaneous move](#SM) game into a [sequential game](#SM) in order to simplify analysis or to
  make the game more tractable for finding solutions. Sequentialization involves introducing an
  artificial order of moves, potentially with [information](#information) revealed to some players
  based on the [actions](#action) of those who moved earlier, even if the original game didn't have
  this sequential structure.

  Generally, [pessimistic sequentialization]{.dfn} is performed such that the player's moves are
  known to their opponent, giving the opponent more information and allowing them to choose
  responses that are most detrimental to the player (compared to [optimistic
  sequentialization]{.dfn} where the reverse is true). A pessimistic ordering generally leads to
  more conservative play focused on minimizing losses whereas optimistic sequentializations are
  riskier but could lead to greater payoffs.
server: |
  Where the game [engine](#engine) is being run and where the actual, complete battle
  [state](#state) is stored. The server is responsible for keeping relevant information hidden from
  the [client](#client).
Shannon Type: |
  A classification of strategies for situations with too many states to explore in the time
  available that was coined by Claude Shannon. In this classification, a [Type A Strategy]{.dfn}
  considers all possible actions to a certain depth of the tree and then uses a
  [heuristic](#heuristic) [evaluation function](#value) to estimate the utility of states at that
  [depth](#depth) (exploring a _wide but shallow_ portion of the tree). In contrast, a [Type B
  Strategy]{.dfn} ignores moves that look bad and follows promising lines "as far as possible"
  (exploring a _deep but narrow_ portion of the tree).
sim: |
  A [simulator]{.dfn} is something that mimics the behavior of something by modeling the underlying
  state of the target, though it doesn't necessarily attempt to do so through [emulation](#emulator)
  of an external device. In the context of Pokémon, _simulator_ more often describes a particular
  platform that provides a venue for online Pokémon battling, and usually involves a game server
  being built around a Pokémon [engine](#engine). [Pokémon Showdown](#PS) is the most comprehensive
  and most popular Pokémon simulator.
SIMD:
  Short for Single Instruction on Multiple Data, SIMD characterizes a type of CPU instruction that
  allows for computing operations in parallel on a vector of numbers.
simplification: |
  See [relaxation](#relaxation).
slot: |
  Refers to the 1-indexed position of either a Pokémon in a player's party (known as a [team
  slot]{.dfn} or [party slot]{.dfn}) or a move in a Pokémon's moveset ([move slot]{.dfn}). Required
  when specifying a player's [action](#action).
SM: |
  A simultaneous move game (also simply [simultaneous]{.dfn} game or static game) is a game where
  each player chooses their action without knowledge of the actions chosen by other players.
  Contrasts an alternating move game ([AM]{.dfn}) (also known as a [sequential]{.dfn} game) where
  play alternates between players and each player is aware of their opponent's prior action.

  SM is also a commonly used abbreviation for Pokémon Sun & Pokémon Moon, the seventh Pokémon
  [generation](#generation).
Smogon: |
  [Smogon University](https://smogon.com), home of competitive Pokémon battling and curator of rules
  and restrictions for the most popular competitive [formats](#format) outside of those supported by
  Nintendo.
sparse: |
  Used to describe something with low [informational
  entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) --- _i.e_, something which
  has comparatively low information per element. A matrix that primarily consists of zeros or a
  [game tree](#game-tree) where most of the branches can be [pruned](#pruning) is considered to
  sparse.
spread: |
  A spread or [EV spread]{.dfn} refers to the distribution of components that make up a Pokémon's
  [stats](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stat) --- primarily [EVs (effort
  values)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Effort_values), but also [IVs (individual
  values)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Individual_values) and
  [nature](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nature). Depending on the context, spread can
  also refer to Pokémon moves that target more than one Pokémon in certain [formats](#format).
STAB: |
  An abbreviation for same-type attack bonus, a game mechanic where a damage boost gets applied to
  attacking moves used by a Pokémon of the same type.
state: |
  The information required to determine which [actions](#action) are available to each
  [player](#player). In Pokémon, this is the *battle*, and the term _battle_ is used as opposed to
  _state_ as _state_ is a loaded term in programming (programming, in general, is arguably all about
  the management of state, so _state_ needs to be qualified as _battle state_ or _game state_ to be
  unambiguous) despite it being a useful term in papers dealing purely with game theory.
stochastic: |
  Used to describe a process characterized by randomness. [Probabilistic]{.dfn} goes further and
  denotes something where the outcome can be described by a probability distribution. Stochastic and
  probabilistic processes are non-deterministic, though [non-deterministic]{.dfn} describes a system
  or process where the outcome can't be predicted with certainty from its initial state (and which
  may have multiple possible outcomes for a single input). Given the subtle distinction between
  these three terms they're often used interchangeably.
strategy: |
  Used interchangeably with [policy](#policy), it refers generically to a plan to achieve an overall
  goal.
subgame: |
  A notion used in the solution concept of subgame perfect [Nash equilibrium](#NE), a refinement of
  the Nash equilibrium that eliminates non-credible threats. Subgames are a subset of a game that
  meets a [specific set of criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgame) and when taken in
  isolation constitutes a game in its own right.
symmetry: |
  Similarity or exact correspondence between different things. In the context of games, symmetry can
  result certain [states](#state) occurring more than once in the [game tree](#game-tree), meaning
  techniques such as [transposition tables](#TT) and [action consolidation](#consolidation)
  can be leveraged to speed up search.
TD-learning: |
  [Temporal difference learning]{.dfn} refers to a class of [model-free](#model) [reinforcement
  learning](#RL) methods which learn by bootstrapping from the current estimate of the [value
  function](#value). These methods sample from the environment and perform updates based on current
  estimates, adjusting predictions to match later, more accurate, predictions about the future
  before the final outcome is known.
Team Preview: |
  A pre-battle phase that was introduced in [Generation V](#generation) in which players get to see
  each of the Pokémon on their opponent's team and choose which Pokémon get brought to battle and in
  which order.
team-building: |
  The component of competitive Pokémon that involves constructing a team [offline](#offline) before
  a battle, usually with the aim of being able to beat the entire [metagame](#metagame).
Thompson sampling: |
  A [bandit](#bandit) algorithm which chooses the [action](#action) that maximizes the [expected
  reward](#value) with respect to a randomly drawn [belief](#belief).
Torch: |
  The de facto standard open-source machine learning and scientific computing framework, most often
  used in Python via [PyTorch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch).
TPCi: |
  [The Pokémon Company International](https://corporate.pokemon.com/), co-owners of the Pokémon
  franchise along with the publisher and trademark-holder, Nintendo, and the developers, [Game
  Freak](#GF).
transformer: |
  A [neural network](#NN) that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in
  sequential data.
transition: |
  The change that a [state](#state) undergoes due to an [action](#action). In the [pkmn](#pkmn)
  engine, this is implemented by a battle's `update` function. In game theory, _turns_ typically
  count transitions (though [not in Pokémon](#turn)), and a transition may produce a
  [payoff](#payoff) or some sort of [observation](#observation).
transitions: |
  The entire set of possible [transitions](#transition) from any given [state](#state). While every
  Pokémon game engine must allow for performing a single transition, performing _all_ transitions at
  once and returning the set of states is a less common feature, and almost always when
  _transitions_ or `transitions` is used in conversation as a noun it's referring to this
  functionality.
transposition: |
  A sequence of moves that results in a position that may also be reached by another, more common
  sequence of moves. Transpositions are a type of [symmetry](#symmetry) and are often handled via
  [transposition table](#TT). True transpositions are uncommon in Pokémon unless some level of
  [abstraction](#abstraction) has been applied.
TT:
  A [transposition table]{.dfn} is a cache of previously seen positions, and associated evaluations,
  in a [game tree](#game-tree) generated by a computer game-playing program. If a position recurs
  via a different sequence of moves, the value of the position is retrieved from the table, avoiding
  re-searching the game tree below that position.
TBS: |
  [Tree-bandit search]{.dfn}, the name for the family of search algorithms which are roughly based
  around [Monte Carlo tree search](#MCTS) but which make use of various [bandit](#bandit) algorithms
  to greatly improve performance and convergence.
tuning: |
  The process of maximizing a [machine learning](#learning) model's performance without overfitting
  or creating too high of a variance, usually via [hyperparameters](#hyperparameter). Tuning is also
  commonly performed on [evaluation functions](#value) (whether learned or hand-crafted) ---
  [genetic algorithms](#genetic-algorithm), mathematical optimization, or other automated approaches
  such as [CLOP](https://www.chessprogramming.org/CLOP) or [Texel's Tuning
  Method](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Texel%27s_Tuning_Method) are often considered.
turn: |
  Game theory uses the term [ply]{.dfn} to refer to one turn taken by one player in a
  [sequential](#SM) game which doesn't apply to Pokémon given that Pokémon is a [simultaneous](#SM)
  game. A _turn_ in Pokémon is a well-defined concept as certain game mechanics depend on its
  definition (_e.g._, residual damage happens at the end of a turn in Pokémon in later generations).
  Instead, it's more useful to reason in terms of [decision points]{.dfn} that occur between
  _updates_ to the battle state (which may happen multiple times in a single turn, _e.g._, due to a
  Pokémon using [Baton Pass](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Baton_Pass_(move)) or fainting)
  --- places where the game requires input from players to proceed. In [Pokémon Showdown](#PS) and
  the [pkmn](#pkmn) engine, a decision point always requires a [joint action](#action), introducing
  the concept of _passing_ / _waiting_ to account for situations where on a console one of the
  players is forced to do nothing while input is collected from their opponent.
UCB: |
  Upper Confidence Bound, a [bandit](#bandit) algorithm commonly used in [tree bandit search](#TBS).
UCT: |
  Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees, the contemporary standard implementation of [Monte Carlo
  tree search](#MCTS) which uses the [UCB](#UCB) algorithm to select promising child nodes to
  expand. See also [tree bandit search](#TBS).
uniform policy: |
  A [policy](#policy) which assigns equal (uniform) probability to each of the [actions](#action)
  possible --- this sort of policy is usually only optimal in the absence of any other
  [information](#information) (_e.g._, at the beginning of a search).
unmake: |
  A function provided by an [engine](#engine) which allows for an [action](#action)'s effect on the
  [state](#state) to be reversed, undoing the update. Not all engines support this feature and not
  all actions made in competitive Pokémon can be trivially reversed. Unmake functionality and the
  faster, incremental, in-place updates it enables can greatly accelerate search performance
  compared to the alternative of being required to copy or move states in memory in order to
  preserve their original value.
usage stats: |
  Statistics processed from a corpus of battle logs that detail the usage of various Pokémon and
  their attributes for a given [format](#format). [Smogon University](#Smogon) produces [public
  statistics](https://www.smogon.com/stats/) calculated from all rated battles on [Pokémon
  Showdown](#PS) each month which they use to influence the tiering decisions for the
  [formats](#format) they maintain, though alternative usage statistics can also be produced for
  specific use cases.
value: |
  The expected [payoff](#payoff) from a given [state](#state), produced by an [evaluation
  function]{.dfn}. Evaluation functions are usually difficult to produce accurately in Pokémon and
  are often approximated with [reinforcement learning](#RL) via a [value network]{.dfn} that assigns
  a value to each state of the game by calculating an expected cumulative score. Evaluation
  functions can be classified as either light (simple and fast) or heavy (complex and detailed),
  with the former being more commonly used in addition to search whereas the latter is intended to
  be used on its own.
vaporware: |
  Software that has been advertised but isn't yet available to use / buy, either because it's only a
  concept or because it's still being written or designed. See also [pkmn](#pkmn).
variant: |
  A variation from the standard rules of competitive Pokémon which usually simplifies /
  [relaxes](#relaxation) certain properties / rules of the game to make it more tractable for AI,
  with the expectation that solutions to a variant are usually useful for generalizing to the
  original ruleset. In computer poker, [Kuhn poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker) is the
  most common simplification studied, whereas in Pokémon there are [numerous potential options of
  variants](/concepts/variants). Note that while the various Pokémon [formats](#format) can be
  considered variants, the term _variant_ is reserved to describe simplifications to the game that
  go beyond the rule changes typical between formats.
WLT: |
  WLT or W/L/T refers to win, loss, and tie (draw) record of a particular [player](#player) or
  [agent](#agent).
wincon: |
  A [win condition]{.dfn} is a Pokémon or scenario that a player needs in order to ensure that they
  win the game.
zero-sum: |
  A [zero-sum game]{.dfn} is a mathematical representation in game theory of a situation that
  involves two sides, where the result is an advantage for one side and an equivalent loss for the
  other, such that the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero. Zero-sum games are a specific
  example of a [constant-sum game]{.dfn}, a concept when the sum of the players' gains and losses is
  a fixed constant $`C`. Constant-sum games can be trivially transformed into a zero-sum game by
  subtracting $`C` from every [payoff](#payoff).
